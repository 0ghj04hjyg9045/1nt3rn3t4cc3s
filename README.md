**Create an environment where people aren’t afraid to speak and ask questions.** This means: No flaming, personal bashing, excessive trolling, out of control arguments, and similar behavior. If something gets out of hand, ping the mods and let them handle it. Don’t take moderation into your own hands.
 


## Terms and Conditions
When you’re making any sort of claim contrary to popular opinion, belief, or guidance, it is your sole responsibility to provide valid evidence and sources to back up your claim. Don’t expect others to do all this research, and don’t continually argue or disagree if you are unwilling to do so.

Avoid discussing controversial or offensive topics. While occasionally warranted, oftentimes topics like politics or religion distract from our goals of education in the privacy and security space, and those topics may be better served elsewhere. Consider whether the discussion really fits the room topic, it may not be constructive in #chat, but may be well received in #politics, for example. More offensive topics including acts of violence, suicide/self-harm, or school shootings are always off-topic and should be avoided. Hate speech including racist, homophobic, sexist, or ableist slurs are always strictly prohibited pursuant to our rules above.
